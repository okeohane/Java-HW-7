Arraylists â€“ Three questions
Problem 1
Write the following method that returns the sum of all numbers in an ArrayList:
public static double sum(ArrayList list)
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter five numbers, stores them in an array list, and
displays their sum.
Problem 2
Write a method that removes the duplicate elements from an arraylist of integers using the following
header:
public static void removeDuplicate(ArrayList list)
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter 10 integers to a list and displays the distinct
integers in their input order and separated by exactly one space.
Here is a sample run:
Enter 10 integers: 34 5 3 5 6 4 33 2 2 4
The distinct integers are 34 5 3 6 4 33 2
Problem 3
Write a method that returns the union of two arraylists of integers using the following header:
public static ArrayList union( ArrayList list1, ArrayList list2)
For example, the addition of two arraylists { 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 } and { 3 , 4 , 6 } is { 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 3 , 4 ,
6 } .
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two lists, each with five integers, and displays their
union. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.
Here is a sample run:
Enter five integers for list1: 3 5 45 4 3
Enter five integers for list2: 33 51 5 4 13
The combined list is 3 5 45 4 3 33 51 5 4 13
